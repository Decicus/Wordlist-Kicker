#Wordlist Kicker#

##What is Wordlist Kicker?##
Wordlist Kicker is a module/addon for the ULX admin mod created for Garry's Mod.  
The module allows server owners or admins to blacklist certain words that you want to prevent people from using in their nickname.  
(Don't mind the name, I think it needs to change too.)

##Planned features:##
- Ability to change where the wordlist is saved.
- Whitelisting users/Steam ID's that will be ignored.

##Current features:##
- Adding/removing words from the wordlist.
- People get kicked if their name contains a blacklisted word on join/when they change their name to contain a blacklisted word.
