#Wordlist Kicker#

##What is Wordlist Kicker?##
Wordlist Kicker is a module/addon for the ULX admin mod created for Garry's Mod.  
The module allows server owners or admins to blacklist certain words that you want to prevent people from using in their nickname.  
(Don't mind the name, I think it needs to change too.)

##Planned features:##
- Ability to change where the wordlist is saved.
- Clearing/deleting every word from the wordlist.

##Current features:##
- Adding/removing words from the wordlist.
- People get kicked if their name contains a blacklisted word on join/when they change their name to contain a blacklisted word.
- Ability to blacklist strings like "www." or "http://". (This has something to do with special characters being used in Lua's string library.)
- Whitelisting users/Steam ID's that will be ignored.

##Planned changes/other additions (non-features):##
- Change opposites (removing words/Steam ID's) to their own functions, for future customizations and better permission-customization for server owners.
